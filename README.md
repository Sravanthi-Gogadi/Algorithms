Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Final Project
Emergency Vehicle dispatch system:
Implemented an algorithm that processes requests one by one. For each request, the algorithm will try to find the closest available emergency vehicle

We adopted the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from the source to the destination

Implemented the algorith using the Python 3 with two classes, as main and Dijkstras

objective:
The objective of the project is to finding and allocating the available emergency vehicle from the nearest zipcode checking on availability providing the Zipcode and Emergency vehicle type as input for the algorithm

Types of vehicles:
Ambulance
Fire Truck
Police
Attributes considered:
Zipcodes as nodes
Distances as the edges weight with connected vertices
Vehicle type: among the above three types
